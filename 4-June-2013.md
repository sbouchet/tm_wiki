Agenda

### Action items from [TM/Meetings/2-Apr-2013](./2-Apr-2013 "TM/Meetings/2-Apr-2013")

*   Review bug backlogs (Fix target milestones; review / triage incoming high-severity issues)
    *   AI All (ongoing)
*   Web Site
    *   AI DaveD - Update Website Docs where they refer to CVS (some done, more to do)
    *   AI DaveD - Maybe update the CVS repo putting in a "readme.txt" that project has migrated to git (still to do)
    *   AI DaveD - Webpages partially out-of-date --> migrate to Wiki; Wayne got something "almost done" that can be auto-generated (PMI - still examining, should be able to do some simplification) (done for the most part)
*   Kepler
    *   AI DaveD - Schedule Kepler release review (done)
    *   AI DaveD - Need to submit IP log 2 weeks prior (done)
    *   AI DaveD - Prepare review materials, secure Tools PMC review (done)
*   TM 3.4.3
    *   AI Martin - Coordinate 3.4.3 build and release.
*   Releng - Tycho versions plugin - causes pom.xml to match MANIFEST.MF
    *   AI Martin - provide a references on the mailing list
    *   AI Anna - do we want to incorporate into build to avoid the pom.xml update problems we get occasionally?
*   Releng - Apache commons.net

### Master branch builds

### Legacy branch builds

*   No releng items

### 3.4.2+ (Juno)

### Kepler

*   Put repository information into the plugins? - Currently building on Tycho 0.15, but 0.16 is available (still true?)
*   Some goodies (eg help index; .api_description) might be missing - not necessarily re-do all of them, but document what's different
*   We have built RC3, RC4 "build" is this weekend. No changes from RC3 are expected.

### Web site & wiki maintenance

    *   Ongoing
*   TM 3.4.3
    *   AI Martin - Coordinate 3.4.3 build and release. We decided that putting out a formal 3.4.3 release is not worth the trouble. We will continue patching on the 3.4 maintenance branch as necessary.
    *   Done
*   Releng - Tycho versions plugin - causes pom.xml to match MANIFEST.MF
    *   AI Martin - provide a references on the mailing list.
    *   AI Anna - do we want to incorporate into build to avoid the pom.xml update problems we get occasionally?
    *   We decided not to use this plugin as part of our builds. We will encourage the use of the platform releng tool that does a pom.xml/MANIFEST.MF check. This should be run prior to commit.
    *   Done
*   Releng - Apache commons.net
    *   AI Martin - look at getting latest commons.net version into orbit now that it has been approved by IP. Try by next Tuesday (May 14).
    *   Done
