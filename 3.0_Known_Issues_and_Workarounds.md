This page lists the **most obvious known issues** with [TM 3.0 Milestones](http://download.eclipse.org/tm/downloads/) and suggests workarounds. By "most obvious" we mean those issues that many users are likely to encounter. Note that there may be other severe or critical issues not listed here, because they are less likely to occur. See the [Bugzilla: TM Major and Critical, P1 and P2](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&product=Target+Management&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&cmdtype=doit&field0-0-0=priority&type0-0-0=regexp&value0-0-0=P%5B12%5D&field0-0-1=bug_severity&type0-0-1=regexp&value0-0-1=blocker%7Ccritical%7Cmajor) query to show those.

Known Problems in TM 3.0.x
--------------------------

[TM 3.0.2](http://download.eclipse.org/tm/downloads/drops/R-3.0.2-200812050230/) is the latest official TM 3.0.x build. See [TM 2.0 Known Issues and Workarounds](./TM_2.0_Known_Issues_and_Workarounds "TM 2.0 Known Issues and Workarounds") for the TM 2.0.x stream.

| **Bug #** | **Description** | **Workaround** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [218387](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=218387) | Problems with large file trees shared through EFS on slow connections | When a large remote file tree is linked into the local workspace as an EFS-shared resouces, the Workbench may appear to hang up or be unresponsive for long times during various operations. The reason seems to be that the Eclipse Workspace and Resources System are not made for lazy operations, so Eclipse tries to access or refresh the entire remote tree during certain operations. Sometimes, these very long running refresh operations can happen at times where they block the entire Eclipse UI and thus make the Workbench unresponsive.    We will look at improving the situation, but for now it is discouraged linking large remote file trees into the Eclipse workspace.   **Workaround:** Use the RSE SystemView to browse large file trees on slow connections. It works fully lazily, not trying to refresh resources that are never needed, and performs caching wherever possible. Link resources into the Workspace only where needed.   For more discussion about the issue, see also [this mailing list message](http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/dsdp-tm-dev/msg01699.html), [bug 195997](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=195997) (rsync file system), [bug 185925](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=185925) (Platform Team/Synchronization integration for RSE)   |
| [181458](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=181458) | Cannot drag&drop / copy&paste from remote to Windows Explorer | We had to take out the "Download on Copy" workaround again because of [critical bug 189268](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=189268). A proper fix will need [bug 196176](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=196176) fixed in SWT. **Workaround:** Copy&Paste to the RSE "Local" file system instead. |
| [153652](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=153652) | Cannot drag&drop from remote into the Project Explorer | We had to take out the "Download on Copy" workaround again because of [critical bug 189268](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=189268). A proper fix will need support for the "PluginTransfer" method in the Project Explorer. **Workaround:** locate the target folder in the RSE Local File Subsystem, and drag and drop to Local in the RSE SystemView instead. |

This will restart the dstore server.   |
