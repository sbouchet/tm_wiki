Target Management 3.2 (Helios) Information
==========================================

Executive Summary
-----------------

While the Remote System Explorer (RSE) continues bringing its steady value to the Community with only small incremental improvements, the TCF component has seen a strong Community uptake and important innovations in the 3.2 Release.

*   RSE 3.2 is mostly a maintenance release (stability, performance, usability)
*   RSE FTP connection has been made robust and slightly faster
*   Terminal now also for Local connections on Linux, Solaris, Mac (incubating); Scroll Lock has been added.
*   TCF new features:
    *   Streams service
    *   Zero Copy binary transfer
    *   Debug Server as Value-add
    *   new targets (Symbian, Mac, x86_64)
    *   dynamic agent plugin system
    *   Eclipse Debugger (EDC) as part of CDT.

The [Helios Tracker for TM](http://eclipse.org/helios/planning/SimultaneousReleaseOverview.php?action=project&projectid=tools.tm) has more information about individual items.

Progressive Disclosure of Features
----------------------------------

A sample plugin showing how to hide RSE contributions to the UI is available from [Eclipse CVS](http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.tm.rse/plugins/org.eclipse.rse.ui.capabilities/plugin.xml?root=Tools_Project&view=markup).

Essentially, RSE functionality is expected to be driven from the "Remote Systems" Perspective. Opening the RSE Perspective should trigger enablement of RSE UI Contributions - although pretty much all of them are in the RSE Perspective only.

Builds
------

TM and RSE is using PDE Build with Mapfiles, fully repeatable and documented on [RSE CVS](http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.tm.rse/releng/org.eclipse.rse.build/README_build.txt?root=Tools_Project&view=markup).

In addition to that, we are using using Athena CBI on [Eclipse Hudson](https://hudson.eclipse.org/hudson/job/cbi-tm-3.2-integration/). The CBI Build is not quite as tested yet as the Legacy build, but we use it for automated unit tests.

Unit Tests
----------

As of the Helios release, TM and RSE run a set of 115 unit tests automatically on each Athena Build: Just by clicking the "build" button on the [Hudson / Athena CBI TM Job](https://hudson.eclipse.org/hudson/job/cbi-tm-3.2-integration/), one will get immediate unit test results.

In addition to that, the TM Unittests are available from the TM Project Repository and CVS. Download tm.rse.tests and "Run as" JUnit plugin test. From source code, a lot of tests can be modified to run against different connection types; increasing unit test coverage is among the plan items for next year's TM 3.3 (Indigo) release.

Finally, even end users can install the TM Tests plugin from the TM Project Repository, without having JUnit or even JDT installed. Just open the RSE Tests view and run the suite.

Retention Policy
----------------

*   **Code in CVS** is left in there forever.
*   **Formal Releases** are left as ZIP downloads forever on the [Eclipse Archive Site](http://archive.eclipse.org/tm/downloads).
    *   Milestone Builds are kept until the next formal release on the [Main Download Site](http://download.eclipse.org/tm/downloads).
    *   The TM Helios Project Repository is expected to be kept forever on [http://download.eclipse.org/tm/updates/3.2](http://download.eclipse.org/tm/updates/3.2) .
