Agenda
------

*   Our top goals
    *   Enable Community Participation, grow the Community
        *   That's the #1 requirement for release review - active user and adopter communities.
        *   We get those through providing something useful for them, and helping them adopt it (tutorial, docs, mailinglist help)
    *   Get the APIs Right
        *   We need to enable API discussions in public.
    *   Get our Processes in place
*   Process/IP/Legal
    *   Comfortable with bugzilla and CVS processes? - [TM Developer Resources](https://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/tm/development/index.php)
    *   tm-log.csv -- questions?
        *   Logging on a per-contribution basis: if multiple patches are on a single bugzilla, each is a line in the log.
        *   Update-change-Commit the log early to avoid merging or making it a bottleneck.
    *   recent contributions: docs, junit, user-actions, import/export
*   RSE/EFS discussion
    *   [RSE API Discussion](./RSE_API_Discussion "RSE API Discussion")
        *   Don't want to make this page a duplicate of the docs. Want to drive API discussions over the javadoc.
        *   Need to reconcile the javadoc with the Wiki page -- make some classes / interfaces internal
        *   Want the Wiki page to be a directory into what's going on / being planned.
        *   SystemMessages API?
    *   [Eclipse File Service APIs Compared](./Eclipse_File_Service_APIs_Compared "Eclipse File Service APIs Compared")
        *   Can we make EFS a Plan item? Any big rocks to overcome? Get help from Tianchao?
        *   Continue discussion with Tianchao; concerned that he only sees "files" while there are other subsystems.
        *   Eclipse 3.2 has chicken&egg problems when creating projects, because temp files are stored in the RemoteSystemsTempFiles project. This leads to race conditions - not sure how to address this, DaveM has a patch for Eclipse to make it work. For now, JDT or CDT do not yet support EFS (Patch from Tianchao for CDT is on [bug 142092](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=142092))
        *   There are other EFS problems, e.g. [bug 134270](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=134270) being deferred to Eclipse 3.3 -- they want to wait until there are more EFS clients
        *   EFS support will most probably remain a Toy until release.
        *   An EFS Browser in RSE seems to be a valuable thing -- could be based on the "Local" system type. Would be a great project for somebody to do, but the RSE core team will not have time to address this soon -- perhaps as an Example late in August.
    *   [RSE 2.0 Planning](./RSE_2.0_Planning "RSE 2.0 Planning")
*   Give better access to docs?
    *   Online browseable docs? - AI Martin: Get this set up
    *   Downloadable compiled docs?
    *   Update Site?
*   Mailing List Duty
    *   All committers should be active on the mailing lists
*   Bugzilla Situation - use "Rember Search as.." in Bugzilla
    *   [RSE Open Major](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&classification=DSDP&product=Target+Management&component=RSE&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&bug_severity=blocker&bug_severity=critical&bug_severity=major&cmdtype=doit)
    *   [RSE Hi-pri Enhancements](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&classification=DSDP&product=Target+Management&component=RSE&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&bug_severity=enhancement&priority=P1&priority=P2&cmdtype=doit)
    *   [141835](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=141835) \- user id is not stored
    *   Edit searches and let bugzilla remember the new ones... e.g. "Assigned to Me"
*   [Last meeting](./Committer_Phone_Meeting_23-May-2006 "DSDP/TM/Committer Phone Meeting 23-May-2006") action items
*   Free discussion -- feelings, comments, critics
*   Next steps
    *   DaveD - contributions(junit, user-actions, import/export), automated builds, bugfixing
    *   DaveM - bugfixing, drive the API discussions, ML duty
    *   Kushal - wizard completely replaceable, ui/non-ui refactoring
