TM/Shared Board Labs
====================

< [TM](./TM "TM")

Lead: TBD  
Members: Wind River, Mentor, Freescale

We want to create frameworks that support connecting to remote databases maintaining shared board labs:

*   search target boards given on a set of properties
*   match properties against requirements given by project or build spec
*   do resource allocations on remote systems (e.g. check-in / check-out target boards)
*   do access control on remote systems (allow certain users only)

This initiative is related to the [DSDP/TM/Target Associations](./Target_Associations "DSDP/TM/Target Associations") initiative.
