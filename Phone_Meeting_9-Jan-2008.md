Notes

### Update on RSE Status

*   **Target Communication Framework** \- [DSDP/TM/TCF FAQ](./DSDP/TM/TCF_FAQ "DSDP/TM/TCF FAQ") available and approved by EMO. Now working on SVN Repository at Eclipse.org
*   **Project Plan Status** \- still on the [TM Future Planning](./TM_Future_Planning "TM Future Planning") page only
*   **Codebase status** \- API changes for TM 3.0 in HEAD stream - See recent 3.0M4 build notes; nothing yet form TM 2.0.3
    *   Latest information about API changes are in the build notes of recent I-builds (weekly every Thursday)
    *   Working on improved release engineering scripts, especially for running unit tests nightly
*   **EclipseCon**
    *   Accepted TM Tutorial (with focus on TCF), and a Short Talk (TM Ganymede News).
    *   RSE also referenced in some other talks

### Committer Discussions

*   DaveM: IBM needs UI for changing ownership and permission bits on remote files
    *   Want a common UI for Dstore, FTP, SSH.
    *   Martin: Remote file systems are different... implement it in the specific subsystem(s) only?
    *   DaveD: Use an Adaptor pattern on the Service? - Would be very flexible since 3rd parties can register an additional Adaptor even for an existing Service
*   DaveM: What about a "DStore-only" connection type?
*   Filter Pools: problems in wizard, might be created against default subsystem instead of the selected one -- DaveD to look into deferring filter creation; Martin: Wizard UI improvement bug (select services first)
*   Remove Kushal and Ted as committers? - Ask Ted and Kushal directly
*   TCF vs ECF - clarified through conf.call -- Scott Lewis wants integration - will work on.

### Community Feedback and Status

*   Community's most wanted
    *   PHP / PDT people hot on EFS fixes and improvements
*   Community contributions
    *   Francesco Crivelli - working on Terminal integration with RSE - To be contributed by end of January
    *   Proposed contribution from Patrick Juhl for SSH Tunnel integration with RSE
    *   RSE being used by the Community, but no contributions for BugDay
*   Questions
