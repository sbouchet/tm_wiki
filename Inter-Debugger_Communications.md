TM/Inter-Debugger Communications
================================

< [TM](/TM "TM")

Lead: TBD (Freescale)  
Members:

We want to create a framework that supports communication between any tools registered with the Target Management Framework. Use-cases include:

*   Collaborative debugging between a DSDP and a general purpose processor in a system-on-a-chip
*   Drop into Hardware Debugging from an OS-aware debugger
*   Events between TM-aware tools (e.g. start profiling / stop profiling)

This initiative is related to the [Hardware Descriptions](/DSDP/DD/Spirit "DSDP/DD/Spirit") initiative.
