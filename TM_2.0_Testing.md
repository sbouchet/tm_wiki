This is the toplevel page for TM 2.0 testing efforts. It is important for all of us to coordinate our efforts

*   In order to get bugs submitted early, such that we can fix them for the release
*   In order to avoid duplication of testing work
*   In order to get a good test coverage and exposure of TM and RSE.
