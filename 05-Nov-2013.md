Agenda
------

### Action items from [TM/Meetings/8-October-2013](/TM/Meetings/8-October-2013 "TM/Meetings/8-October-2013")

*   Review bug backlogs (Fix target milestones; review / triage incoming high-severity issues)
    *   AI All
    *   Ongoing
*   Bugs
    *   Still problems with RSE initialization - probably due to stuff being done by extensions. DaveM and DaveD to follow up.
*   Web Site
    *   AI DaveD - Update Website Docs where they refer to CVS (some done, more to do)
    *   AI DaveD - Maybe update the CVS repo putting in a "readme.txt" that project has migrated to git (still to do)
    *   AI DaveD - Webpages partially out-of-date --> migrate to Wiki; Wayne got something "almost done" that can be auto-generated. (done for the most part)
*   Integration and Build
    *   AI Manuel to write up a brief gerrit "how-to"
    *   AI Anna to investigate HIPP for TM - Do we need one? How do we request one? How do we migrate our jobs?

### Bugs

*   Still problems with RSE initialization - probably due to stuff being done by extensions. DaveM and DaveD to follow up.

Minutes
-------

### Resolved Action items

*   Anna - HIPP instance being brought up. Not quite there. FindBugs is misbehaving. Overall the instance is much easier to manage and is much faster than shared Hudson.
*   DaveD - Greg Watson is amenable to taking on the role of project lead if there is not too much work involved.
*   DaveD - Our 3.6 M3 is out and contributed to Luna.

### New Action Items

*   Anna - continue to bring up HIPP
*   Anna and DaveD - Adjust the nightly build to finish up some packaging steps for the update and download sites
*   DaveD - Luna M4
*   DaveD - Hand project lead duties off to Greg Watson
*   All - watch the newsgroup more closely
