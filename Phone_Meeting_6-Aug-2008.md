Notes

### Last Meetings

*   Last [DSDP/TM/Phone Meeting 2-Jul-2008](./DSDP/TM/Phone_Meeting_2-Jul-2008 "DSDP/TM/Phone Meeting 2-Jul-2008")
*   Last [DSDP/TM/Committer Phone Meeting 16-Jul-2008](./DSDP/TM/Committer_Phone_Meeting_16-Jul-2008 "DSDP/TM/Committer Phone Meeting 16-Jul-2008")

### TM 3.1 Project Plan

*   TM Plan rendered [here](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/project-plan.php?projectid=dsdp.tm), along with a [DSDP/TM/3.1 Ramp down Plan](./DSDP/TM/3.1_Ramp_down_Plan "DSDP/TM/3.1 Ramp down Plan")
*   Using target milestones for "committed" (actual milestone), "proposed" (3.1 or ---) and "deferred" (Future)
*   Using Summary tags in square brackets for Themes
*   **EFS** \-\- potentially lots of effort getting it right, unclear staffing and benefit. **AI DaveM** comment on IBM plans regarding EFS when back from vacation
*   Componentization -- unclear staffing, except for critical bugs related. Not going to buy IBM anything. Will look at it again when bugzilla queries are rendered properly.
*   Xuan: Reference Platforms - Linux PPC for dstore agent, Linux x86_64 for Client ? - Can add Reference Platforms when sombody is there to actually staff some testing.

### TM 3.0.1 Planning

*   Google Calendar / [DSDP/TM/3.0 Ramp down Plan for Ganymede](./DSDP/TM/3.0_Ramp_down_Plan_for_Ganymede "DSDP/TM/3.0 Ramp down Plan for Ganymede")
*   Branching on Aug 20th might be too early to get critical fixes in. **AI DaveM, DaveD** decide until Tues Aug 12 COB whether we need to move the branching date from Aug 20th to Aug 27th or not -- Martin needs to know in order to schedule WR testing.
*   Kevin: [bug 187739](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=187739) collapse child tree when parents are refreshed -- Martin won't have time for 3.0.1, reassign to DaveM, he might have code to fix this already.

### Other Stuff

*   DSDP PMC Board Presentation Review by IBM -- Martin to bring up at PMC meeting tomorrow, but cannot guarantee end of August deadline for making it public.
