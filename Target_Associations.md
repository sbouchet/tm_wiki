TM/Target Associations
======================

< [TM](/TM "TM")

Lead: TBD  
Members: Wind River, Mentor

We want to associate remote system connections with projects, or build specs:

*   either manually, or
*   automatically by matching properties of a project or build against properties of a connection.

This should help developers who open a certain project or perform a certain build, to (automatically) find the proper targets for running their build on, from a given pool of targets.

This initiative is related to the [DSDP/TM/Shared Board Labs](/DSDP/TM/Shared_Board_Labs "DSDP/TM/Shared Board Labs") initiative.
