Notes

### Update on RSE Status

*   **Target Communication Framework** \- [DSDP/TM/TCF FAQ](./TCF_FAQ "DSDP/TM/TCF FAQ") available and approved by EMO. Now working on SVN Repository at Eclipse.org
*   **Project Plan Status** \- still on the [TM Future Planning](./TM_Future_Planning "TM Future Planning") page only
    *   Bugzilla plan items as well as an "official" project plan will be done
    *   Focus on TCF; RSE bug-fixes and quality; UI/Non-UI splitting; Import/Export of Profiles
*   **Codebase status** \- API changes for TM 3.0 in HEAD stream - See recent 3.0M4 build notes
    *   Collecting requested backport changes for TM 2.0.3
    *   Latest information about API changes are in the build notes of recent I-builds (weekly every Thursday)
    *   Working on improved release engineering scripts, especially for running unit tests nightly
*   **EclipseCon**
    *   Accepted TM Tutorial (with focus on TCF), and a Short Talk (TM Ganymede News).
    *   RSE also referenced in some other talks

### User Actions

*   Xuan: Discussed how the rse useractions can go into Open Source

*   **Subsystem Families** ([bug 217894](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=217894):
    *   Want to contribute user actions to subsystem families
    *   Martin would tie "family" to the connectorservice. Then it's orthogonal to the subsystem category. Add a "connectorserviceid" to SubsytemConfiguration plugin.xml
    *   SystemType is also some kind of grouping. What's the definition of a Family compared to SystemType?
        *   Martin had the idea of making systemType more flexible with Properties, or "derived" systemType - [bug 170918](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=170918)

### Community Feedback and Status

*   Community's most wanted
    *   PHP / PDT people hot on EFS fixes and improvements
*   Community contributions
    *   Francesco Crivelli - Terminal integration with RSE - no code received yet, currently not available
    *   Patrick Juhl - SSH Tunnel - no more news
    *   [bug 214887](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=214887) Windows CE - interesting contribution
    *   RSE being used by the Community, but no contributions for BugDay
*   Questions
